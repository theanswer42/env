# Environment setup
## zsh, oh-my-zsh
Currently trying out zsh. There are some adjustments, but I might stick with it.

Installation is pretty straightforward from: https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh

See .zshrc.
## powerline
```
sudo apt install powerline
```
See powerline config in the powerline directory.

## emacs
See [emacs.readme.md](emacs.readme.md)

## kde autostart
```
mkdir -p ~/.config/autostart-scripts
cp autostart-scripts/* ~/.config/autostart-scripts
```
