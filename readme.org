* emacs setup
Setup of emacs is done. org-mode now default for everything.

* ruby :rvm:
  rvm install complete. There were a few issues along the way: 
  
  - rvm install worked fine, but rvm install ruby-head did not
  
  - rvm needs ruby build packages (apt-get build-dep ruby), which I did not 
    realize. For a while there were 404 while trying to apt-get update
    which made things worse. 
    
  - After installing ruby, realized that rvm was not loading as a function, 
    because the rvm script was not being sourced from bash_profile. 
    Found out that bash_profile/.profile does not automatically get sourced
    by terminals, and is only sourced by "login" shells. 
    Added the source lines to bashrc and now things work. 

* git
  Now need to set up git. I keep forgetting how to do this.
  git config --global user.name "Sagar Gokhale"
  git config --global user.email ""
